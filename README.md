## UX/UI

The design of the website is a one-page application that offers a clean modern & user-friendly design. I used Adobe xd to help design the layout on mobile & desktop devices.

## Project aim

This web application was made to view locations in Ireland that can be visited specifically cycle locations throughout Ireland. The application uses 3 API's to retrieve and send data. The user would be given a list of location along with map data & current weather data for that area. There is a contact form for the user to send a message for a question they may have on the locations.

## Features

- Interacted with Google map API to display markers on a map using location data from sportireland.ie for cycle trails throughout Ireland

- Interacted with Open weather API to retrieve weather data from locations in Ireland. The data from the API displays current weather temperature, a weather description of the current weather & a weather icon id to display icons for the given weather conditions.

- Integrated emailJS API to receive email from users to would take in users email & message would send the email on to Gmail account.


# Future features I would like to add.

Implement dropdown navigation where the user can choose from a list of popular travel destinations, museums, & hotels. It would display a list of data with an image & map location with the weather.


## Testing

I tested the application using both chrome developer tools for javascript testing to test the API calls & console log errors & to console log the object data from the weather API. I have tested the application across 3 browsers. Safari, Chrome browser & Mozilla Firefox. I used google chrome tools console to check for errors deteced when loading.

I used Firefox to view the application on different user devices, mobile, desktop & the application responsiveness between those sizes.

For HTML & CSS validation I used W3c validator to check for any errors. There are warnings detected on the HTML empty headers where the weather API data is inserted into the DOM. I left the h2 elements for the descriptions to dislay a heading 2 HTML tags.

To view changes made throughout development, I used Visual studio code with a live server plugin to view any changes made.

## Source control & deployment

I used Github integrated with visual studio code to keep track of my changes and deploy the final project.
