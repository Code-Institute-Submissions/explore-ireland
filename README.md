The project can be viewed at the https://ciaran-toner.github.io/explore-ireland/


## UX/UI

The design of the website is a one page application that offers a clean modern & user friendly design. I used Adobe xd to help deisgn the layout on mobile & desktop devices.


## Features


# Future features I would like to add.

Implement a dropdown navigation where the user can choose from a list of popular travel destnations, museums, & hotels. It would display a list of data with a image & map location with weather.

HTML 5

Javascript

Interacted with Google map Api to display markers on map using object data from sportireland.ie

Interacted with Open weather Api to retrive weather data from locations in Ireland. The data from the API was current weather temperature, weather description, weather icon id to display icons for the given weather conditions.

Intergrated emailJS API to recieve email from users to would take in users email & message would would send the email on to gmail account.

Vanilla CSS
I did not use any CSS libraries or frameworks in this project as I felt it would be a great learning opportunity to use vanilla CSS. This provided me with a greater understanding off CSS and all it has to offer.

SCSS
I wanted to use a file structuring method rather than one main CSS file & to try to introduce modular CSS components to the site. Although I mainly just wrote CSS it was great to learn about sass and its benefits.



## Testing

This web application was made to view loactions in Ireland that can be visited spefically cycle areas in throughout Ireland. The application uses 3 API's to retrive data from. 

My main testing was done using Firefox developer edition browser & visual studio code editor as I think Firefox offers great features for CSS & specifically when using CSS grid. I also tested across different browsers such as chrome & safari to see if there were any issues, the only ones I came across was when I was using safari on my mobile. Such as, on the main page, cards are set to hover but the function does not work well on safari mobile.

I used visual studio code with 4 plugins to help with development.

Beautify ( To maintain code indentation )
Live server ( This reloads the page when changes are made to the code )
Sass live reloader ( This reloaded the page when changes where made to sass & compiles sass files into one main CSS file & provied fall backs for older
browsers. The vs code folder contains the json file needed for the compile the sass.
Code snape ( I used this to take a picture of my folder structure )
The main issue I came across the was positioning of elements using CSS grid and later flexbox. I tried to implement both throughout the site to provide me with a
a better understanding of when to use either or both.

Font sizes
Colors & accessibility in general for screen readers using SVG icons & links
Loading assets locally such as fonts & icons for the project, rather than using google fonts & Font awsome
To check for HTML errors I used validator.org. There were warnings on the hyphens in the comments of the body but no errors. To check the CSS I used Jigsaw.org. Warnings were found for css falback rules relating to webkit rules applied but no errors.

Source control & deployment

I used Github intergrated with visual studio code for source control & deployment. I mainly would write & test the CSS changes in Firefox developer tools before comiting to Github.



##Technologies Used

HTML5
SCSS / CSS 
Javascript
Google fonts
Github
Google Chrome developer
Firefox developer tools
Adobe XD
Visual studio code

## Testing

I tested the application using both chrom developer tools for javascript testing to test the API calls & console log errors. 
I used mozilia firefox test & implement the css.


Running the project locally

I used Visual studio code with a live server pluigin & github plugin to keep track of my code & to push code to Github.
